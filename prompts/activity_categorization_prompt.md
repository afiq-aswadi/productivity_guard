Analyze these screenshots and categorize the current activity. Look at both monitors together as they belong to the same user.

IMPORTANT: These screenshots are from TWO MONITORS for the same user, so consider them together.

Note: Text content from the screens has been extracted using OCR and will be provided separately to help with analysis. If there is no text content, ignore this note.

Categorize the activity into ONE of these categories:

**PRODUCTIVE ACTIVITIES:**
- CODING: Programming, code editing, terminal work, IDE usage, debugging
- STUDYING: Reading documentation, learning materials, research papers, educational content
- MEETINGS: Video calls (Focusmate, Google Meet, Zoom), collaborative work

**GUIDELINES:**
- Default to PRODUCTIVE if activity could reasonably be work-related
- Brief searches related to work should be categorized as the main work activity
- Consider the overall context and what appears to be the primary focus
- If multiple activities are visible, categorize based on the dominant/active window
- When in doubt between categories, choose the more productive interpretation
